# JavaScript Equality

This application shows the JavaScript value-comparison operators `==` and `===`
in action. It is written in React.js and TypeScript and inspired by the [JavaScript Equality
Table](https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/).

To quote Douglas Crawford:

> My advice is to never use the evil twins. Instead, always use `===` and `!==`.
